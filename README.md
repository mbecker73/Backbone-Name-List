This simple JavaScript application creates a list of names rendered using Backbone.js.  The user can sort the list by dragging and dropping the names (done using jQuery) and when a name is clicked, the user is alerted of the value of the name clicked.  
Used as an introductory application to learning about backbone.js.  The list is populated from sample data from a MySQL database.  

Live version of this code is available at www.matthewscottbecker.com/list.php.
